title: ML and mHealth for infectious disease prediction
description: "The general aim of this project is to create new machine learning models the can be used across different infectious diseases to predict diagnosis, prognosis, and forecasts, using a combination of data sources, including clinical symptoms, contact networks, and genome sequences. We are currently working on hemorrhagic viral diseases such as Ebola and Lassa fever that particularly affect low income regions in the world where access to clinical care is limited. Therefore, we are interested in translational approaches that could make these models useful through low cost technologies such as mobile phones and rapid diagnostic testing."
