title: Visualization of large-scale biomedical datasets
description: "Availability of biomedical datasets of increasing size and complexity gives opportunities to create new visualization tools to gain insight from these datasets. With my work with Processing I wanted to bring science into art - that experience motivated me to now bring art into science by creating new scientific visualization tools and to be able to find possible answers to the question: what are the “next generation” visualization methods for biomedical data?"
