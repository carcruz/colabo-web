title: Digital epidemiology and simulated outbreaks
description: Here at CoLabo we study the epidemiology of infectious diseases by applying novel mathematical modeling and computer simulation approaches. We are interested in aggregating heterogeneous data sources, including contact tracing data, clinical symptoms, and population-level variables such as case counts, in order to make riks predictions. We are also developing participatory simulation tools that allow spreading a virual pathogen using smartphones' proximity sensing capabilites and generating synthetic epidemiological datasets to be be used for model validation. These tools have applications in STEM education as well, by supporting experiential outbreak exercises in various educational settings.
