title: STEM education outreach and sci/art experiments
description: At CoLabo, we are looking forward to engage with the wider community through projects that have applications in STEM education and also through experimentation at the interface between science and art. Research in bioinformatics has a growing social impact as computational study of biomedical data leads to novel treatment of diseases and other advancements. Thus, weâ€™ll aim at reaching out to the community to facilitate conversations and interest in STEM topics.
