Mansi is a graduate student pursuing Masterâ€™s in Information Design and Data Visualization at Northeastern University. Prior to that, she pursued Architecture studies back in India but her curiosity about design in the digital space led to her transition into the UI/UX field. She is interested in learning more about inclusive and accessible design for the web. She is currently interning at CoLabo as a UX design intern designing for the Operation Outbreak project. Outside of work, she loves her evening stroll around the Boston public gardens, doodling, and trying out new art techniques.
